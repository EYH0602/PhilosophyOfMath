#  Linguistic Framework

## As-ifism

1. As-ifism from Plato
  + Axiomatic Method: treat axioms as if they were true for the purpose of solving a problem.
  + truth -> existence
2. Hilbert: axiomatic theory as *schema* for talking about concepts
  + axioms implicitly define concepts 'point', 'line', 'plane'
  + anything that satisfies these axioms are the objects: point, line, and plane (variable domain)
  + (relative) consistency ->(by satisfaction) truth -> existence
  + Fregean: existence -> truth -> consistence $\neq(P \land \neg P)$
    - fixed domain
3. Dedekind: structuralism
  + Peano Axioms: natural numbers are anything satisfies the $PA$
  + structure is prior to object
  + object is position in a *system*(set) that has a structure
4. structuralist background theories
  + in re / ante rem
  + set theory / category theory -> fixed domain
  + -> foundations in the Fregean sense

* empirical rules
* logical rules (proposition respects definitions and logical rules)

---

* if someone wishes to speak in his language about a new kind of entities, he has to introduce a system of new ways of speaking, subject to new rules; we shall call this procedure the construction of a *linguistic framework*
* internal questions are either empirical or logical - these are the only questions that make sense
* the acceptance of a linguistic framework is a *practical matter*, not a true/false one
* it can be judged as begins made more or less expedience, fruitful, conducive to *the aim for* which the language is intended -> as-ifism

category theory as a Carnapian language for mathematical structuralism.
* system that have a structure
* objects as positions in the structure
* object is characterized by its relations
