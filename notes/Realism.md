# Philosophy of Mathematics

* Everyday objects
  * tables, chairs
* scientific objects
  * strings, electrons
* mathematical objects
  * numbers, sets, functions, groups, rings

$\Rightarrow$ realism or non-realism

Realists don't have to commit to all the objects.

## Realism
1. object exists independent of us
2. the way they are in physical, scientific, or mathematical **realm** fixes truth
   * truth doesn't depend on us 
3. we came to know those objects directly or indirectly (through some experiments)
   1. reason $\implies$ rationalists
   2. senses $\implies$ empiricists

## Non-Realism

> most are empiricists
> the senses only give ideas

1. Idealism
    * I have an idea of ..., but it is in me, not the world.
    * tends to be egnostic about the existence of objects
2. Nominalism: objects are names
3. Fictionalism: objects are fictions $\rightarrow$ objects may not be true
4. Constructionist: construct a proof of the existence of something.
   * a object is true, false, or none/unknown before is is proved.
