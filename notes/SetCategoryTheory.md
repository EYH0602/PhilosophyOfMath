# Theory of Structure

> **NOTE** Hilbert/Dedekind Structuralism

> relative consistent axioms -> concepts -> truth -> existence

*background mathematical theory* instead of background metaphysical theory
fir structure (ante rem) | system that has a structure (in re)

1. set theory
   1. ZFC
   2. ZF (without choice)
   3. Type Theory
   4. GB (class theory)
   5. GU (universe)
2. category theory
   1. <u>as if</u> it is the foundation

* set theory as a foundation
  * Fregeian: sets fixes reference or meaning
  * Carnap: 

## ZFC Set Theory

*Axioms*
1. Extensionality: if $X$ and $Y$ have same members, they are the same set.
2. Null set: $\emptyset$ exists
3. Pairing: there is a unique pair set for each $x$ and $y$m $\{x, y\}$
4. Power set: every set has a unique power set
5. Unions: there is a unique union of any set $\cup$
6. Infinity: there is a unique set with infinitely many numbers. (guaranty at least one $\omega$-sequence)
7. Separation: for any set $S$, we can form the subset of $S$ using predicate
8. Replacement: For every given *definable function* with domain a set A, there is a set whose elements are all the values of the function.
9. Regularity: Every non-empty set $A$ contains an $\in$-minimal element, that is, an element such that no element of A belongs to it.
10. Choice:  For every set $A$ of pairwise-disjoint non-empty sets, there exists a set that contains exactly one element from each set in $A$

* Fregeian: does this tells us what set is/what set means?
* Hilbert: any thing satisfies these axioms is a set
