# Structuralism

## Frege

### Arithmetic

* define concept of number
  * logic along
* concept $\mathbb{N}$
  * *falls under* objects
  * whatever satisfies the concepts
* generate axioms from concepts
* sentences follow from the definitions by proof

### Geometry
* definitions
  * construct from the intuition of space
* axioms
* sentences follow from definitions + axioms by proof

syntactic proof $Ax \vdash S$

definition/axioms $\rightarrow$ truth $\rightarrow$ consistency

## Hilbert

### Geometry

* axioms
  * implicitly define the things that satisfies them
* sentences follows from axioms

> syntactic notion of proof

consistency of axioms $\rightarrow$ truth $\rightarrow$ existence

> semantic notion
>
> using $\mathbb{R}$ to model the axioms

* whatever satisfies the axioms
* point, line, plane are implicitly defined
  * they mean whatever the axioms says they mean
* axioms are schema for concepts
* variable domains, no fixed meaning *semantic notion*
