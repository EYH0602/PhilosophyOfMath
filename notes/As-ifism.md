# Mathematical Platonism

Platonism - Realist world of objects

1. these objects exists independently
2. that the way things are in this realm of objects fixes truth about them
3. we come to know these via reason through the dialectical method.

## Intelligible  Realm

Reason/Understanding

| Hypothetical Method | Dialectical Method  |
|:--------------------|:--------------------|
| mathematics         | philosophy          |
| method              | metaphysics         |
| object of thought   | object of knowledge |

**NOTE** there is no evidence that these two combine together

## Realist

'2 is even' is true analogous to 'the ball is red' is true
* '2' refers to **object 2** which satisfies the predicate even
* 'ball' refers to **object ball** and ball satisfies the predicate red

for the above to hold, both object has to exist in the realm.

Realists explain truth in terms notion of satisfaction, 
and satisfaction comes from of reference.

$$
\text{existence} \rightarrow \text{truth}
$$

# As-ifism
* take our hypothesis <u>as if</u> they were first principles
  + as if they were true
* make use of **stable** definitions
  + e.g. the definition of square, diagonal, etc.
* make use of same deduction process
* conclusion

$$
\text{truth} \rightarrow \text{existence}
$$

get **existence** in a different way.

For example, 
start with arithmetic definition of number can never reach a conclusion to solve Meno, 
since $2\sqrt{2}$ not exists.
But if start with geometric definition of number, we can solve the Meno.

## If-thenism (deductionism)

$$
\mathbb{P} \implies Q
$$

If $\mathbb{P} A$, then $2 + 2 = 4$.
where If-then is accounted for by proof.

Pb: Godel's theorems.

Pb: of trivial-truth. e.g. if $\mathbb{P}^2 A$ is false, then $2 + 2 = 4$ is true.
