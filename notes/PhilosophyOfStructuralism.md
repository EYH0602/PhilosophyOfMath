# Mathematical Structure

* mathematics is concerned with structure not objects
* mathematical axioms express the relational structure (Bernays)
* axioms define *structure*(Hilbert), or they define *systems that have a structure* (Dedekind)
* an object is just a position in a structure/a system that has a structure

recall $P^2 A$, 
the object $\mathbb{3}$ is just a position in any systems that satisfies $P^2A$.
$\{\{\{\emptyset\}\}\}, 3, |||$ can all be in this position, 
so can all be the object $\mathbb{3}$.

* structure is *prior* to objects?
  + objects are *nothing but* position in a structure
    - we ignore all non-structural properties
  + rejection of mathematical realism (for objects)

But, 
1. what is a structure, what is a system?
2. what does *priority* mean?
   1. ontological sense
   2. semantic sense
   3. **methodological sense**

* *Object-level* conditions for speaking about *objects* are found in our axiomatic theory
  * numbers, groups, sets, etc

## Priority Question

3 senses of priority

1. ontological sense
  * structures are ontologically prior to objects
  * Shapiro - ante rem
2. semantic sense
  * *systems that have a structure* are semantically prior to objects
  * Hellman - in re
3. methodological sense
  * system that have a structure are methodologically prior to object
  * Reck's interpretation of Dedekind - in re

* ante rem: before the thing, Platonism (rationalism)
* in re: in the thing, Aristotle (empiricist)

"The rose is red"
* in re: redness is in the rose, we come to know red by individuals of roses. 
  * universal in the particular
  * there are only particulars
* ante rem: the rose is red because it exemplifies/instantiates Redness. 
  * universal over and above the particular
  * Types over above tokens

Q. *meta-level* conditions for speaking about structure or systems?

* Shapiro: actual abstract structures
  * $\{\mathbb{1}, \mathbb{2}, \mathbb{3}, \mathbb{4}, \ldots\}$ be places in all systems satisfy $P^2A$
  * the concept of Red is the abstraction of collection of all possible things that are red
* Hellman: *possible* concrete system
  * modal logic -> possibility
  * possible world semantics -> concrete systems
  * possible concreta
  * how can we give meaning to the claim that such systems are possible?

## As-ifism

* we act as if our axioms are true and this allows us to make methodological use of objects for the purpose of solving problems
* we use category theory as a background language to talk about systems that have a structure.

* axioms -> structure -> objects
* Hilbert: consistency -> truth -> exist - object level
* Frege: existence -> truth -> consistency - meta level

for Shapiro and Hellman,
background theories are taken to give
* actual structure - realism
* possible system - nominalist
