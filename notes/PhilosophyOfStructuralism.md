# Mathematical Structure

* mathematics is concerned with structure not objects
* mathematical axioms express the relational structure (Bernays)
* axioms define *structure*(Hilbert), or they define *systems that have a structure* (Dedekind)
* an object is just a position in a structure/a system that has a structure

recall $P^2 A$, 
the object $\mathbb{3}$ is just a position in any systems that satisfies $P^2A$.
$\{\{\{\emptyset\}\}\}, 3, |||$ can all be in this position, 
so can all be the object $\mathbb{3}$.

* structure is *prior* to objects?
  + objects are *nothing but* position in a structure
    - we ignore all non-structural properties
  + rejection of mathematical realism (for objects)

But, 
1. what is a structure, what is a system?
2. what does *priority* mean?
   1. ontological sense
   2. semantic sense
   3. **methodological sense**
