# Socratic's Method (Elenchus)

**aim**: remove false opinion

**reductio**
Elenchus reduces you to a mass of helpless.

$$
P \implies Q \implies \cdots \implies \neg Q
$$

1. $P$ has to be something that the interlocutor firmly believes or claims to know.
2. Socrates himself disallows knowledge, *internal inconsistency*

## Meno's Paradox

how will we look for something when we don't know what it is;
how will we know we've found it when we don't at least know what it is.

### Myth of Recollection

> to calm Meno

as offered by priests and poets.
But recollection is **not** the method of the Meno.

## Mathematician's Method (Hypothetical Method)

start with some hypothesis $H$, then
$$
H \implies Q, \text{ but } \neg Q, \implies \neg H
$$

**Proof**
suppose virtue is knowledge, then it is teachable.
But there are no teachers of virtue, which is a contradiction.
Thus virtue is not knowledge.

### The Mathematical Demonstration

> The Meno Demonstration

* definition
  * square
  * area of a square
* question: how do we double the are of the square?
  * $\implies$ what is the length of the side that will double the area of the square?
* do you know the defn of the diagonal of the square?
  * do you agree if we draw the diagonal it will half the are of the square

$H$: let the length of the line be diagonal of the smaller squares

mathematician's method yields a type of "knowledge".
