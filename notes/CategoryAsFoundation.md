# Category Theory

1. Take CT as a Hilbertian framework/schema for talking about mathematical objects
   1. EM: A category is a *two sorted system* of objects and arrows such that the axioms are satisfied
   2. ETCS: A category is a two sorted system with sets as 'object' and functions as 'arrow'
   3. CCAF: A category is a two sorted system with categories as 'objects' and functors as 'arrows' ($Cat$). -> meta-language that allows you to talk about category itself. 

Pb: does CT <u>depend on</u> set theory / class theory?
1. Feferman: the notion of set is logically/epistemological/conceptually prior 

Pb: Shapiro: you can be a Hilbertian about CT at the object level but not the meta-level;
at the meta-level you have to ST as a Fregeian foundation.

(regress objection)

Pb: size
* set of all sets -> classes -> universes
* define a category as a set/class/universe of objects and arrows
  * background meta-theories
  * this background meta-theory has to be taken as a true Fregean foundation., otherwise we have an (infinite) regress of meta-theories

solution:
1. use CCAF axioms as meta language
   1. Pb: $CAT$ is large, that is would not be well-formed, then need to go to set/class/universes

* Shapiro: regress will only be stopped by some Fregean meta-mathematical theory
* Hellman: the if-thenist attempt to stop the regress will end in the problem facing the deductist.

if class theory, the CCAF.
if set theory, then CCAF.

As-ifism: take background not as Fregean foundation, as if they were consistent.
